        <h2> Summary & Reviews</h2>
        <p> This book was recommended to me by my sister and my interest in thriller books started with this one.</p>
        <p> This novel follows a young man Etienne who lost his memories from before he was eight because of an accident that occured during his childhood. </p>
        <p> He starts a new job teaching fantasy litterature and during his new commuting journey from the university to his Montreal apartment, he meets a hitchhiker, Alex.</p>
        <p> Alex claims to be his childhood friend and begins to help Etienne recall his forgotten memories. </p>
        <p> Fast paced book -- I read it in one sitting.</p>
